# 🎯 CONTENT AUDIT & BUSINESS MODEL ALIGNMENT

## 📋 Current Content Issues to Fix

### ❌ **Adoption-Focused Language (NEEDS TO CHANGE)**

**Current Issues Found:**

1. **AdoptionForm Component** (`/src/components/adoptions/AdoptionForm.tsx`)

   - Form title: "Adopt {petName}"
   - Button text: "Contact Breeder on WhatsApp"
   - Message: "This info helps breeders identify serious adopters"
   - **SHOULD BE**: "Express Interest" or "Contact for Purchase"

2. **PetCard Component** (`/src/components/cards/PetCard.tsx`)

   - Button text: "Adopt Me Today! 💕"
   - Message: "Ready to bring joy to your family"
   - Function names: `handleChooseMe`, `handleAdoptionSubmit`
   - **SHOULD BE**: "I'm Interested" or "Contact Breeder"

3. **Hero Section Content**

   - References to "adoption events", "adoption process"
   - **SHOULD BE**: "Pet Matching Events", "Purchase Process"

4. **General Messaging**
   - Too much emphasis on "adoption" vs "premium pet marketplace"
   - Missing emphasis on your role as trusted middleman
   - No mention of commission-based model
